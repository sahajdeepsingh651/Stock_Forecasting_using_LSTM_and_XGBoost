# About

About this project titled "Stock Ticker Analysis and Prediction System using Stacked LSTM" or **Ticker-Prediction System**. It works on LSTM architecture which is an advanced version of RNN (Type of Neural Navigated Network).

- In this project, I have incorporated different data-preprocessing techniques for continuous dataset value.
- Also, in this project, I have incorporated XG-Boost as ensemble method to increase accuracy of following LSTM model.

**NOTE: All test and research work are done and are pushed in different repository related to this project trained on different epoch cycles and parameters, which are usable with project.**

## Description

- Our project works on concepts of deep learning to predict values based on time-series model. It includes use of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) with XG-Boost to enhance the performance of prediction. Also, it takes tickers as input and gives prediction results.

- This repository invloves deployment of model with **two-interfaces**.
One with <kbd> Streamlit-App </kbd>  [**[Link](https://ticker-prediction-app-tpa.streamlit.app/)**] and <kbd> React App </kbd>

- For versioning of project deployement,We have created docker images for respective project to track and observe major changes made in the application.
Each of these images are tagged with different versions which can be easily pulled into your system.
